# 🚀 Arxiv Agent Features

## 🌟 Key Capabilities

### 🧠 Hybrid Knowledge System
- **Always Helpful**: Never returns "no papers found" - uses Gemini's knowledge as fallback
- **Knowledge-Based Responses**: Comprehensive answers using Gemini's training
- **Paper-Enhanced Responses**: Combines general knowledge with specific research findings
- **Intelligent Fallbacks**: Automatically selects best response strategy

### 🔍 Advanced Search
- **Multi-Stage Retrieval**: Semantic + title-based + keyword matching
- **Smart Reranking**: Multiple relevance signals with diversity filtering
- **Query Expansion**: Automatic expansion with synonyms and related terms
- **Context Integration**: Uses conversation history for better results

### 💬 Enhanced User Experience
- **Streamlit Web UI**: Beautiful, interactive interface
- **CLI Interface**: Powerful command-line tools
- **Conversation Context**: Maintains context across questions
- **Real-time Metrics**: Transparent scoring and relevance indicators

## 🛠️ Technical Features

### Advanced RAG Pipeline
- **Dual-Index Architecture**: Separate semantic and title indices
- **Enhanced Chunking**: Sentence-aware text segmentation
- **Quality Scoring**: Multi-signal relevance assessment
- **Diversity Filtering**: Prevents redundant results

### Response Generation
- **Hybrid Prompting**: Combines knowledge with paper findings
- **Proper Citations**: Clear attribution for claims
- **Technical Depth**: Research-appropriate detail level
- **Structured Output**: Well-organized responses

## 📊 Performance

### Response Quality
- ✅ 4000-6000+ character comprehensive responses
- ✅ Proper citations and source attribution
- ✅ Technical depth appropriate for researchers
- ✅ 100% query success rate (never fails to respond)

### Search Quality

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. **Set API Key**: Add `GOOGLE_API_KEY` to `.env` file
3. **Run Web Interface**: `streamlit run app.py`
4. **Or Use CLI**: `python cli.py --interactive`

## 📝 Example Usage

```python
from arxiv_agent import ArxivAgent

# Initialize agent
agent = ArxivAgent()

# Ask general questions (uses Gemini's knowledge)
response = agent.chat("What are transformers in machine learning?")

# Search and load papers for specific research
papers = agent.search_papers("attention mechanisms", max_results=5)
agent.build_knowledge_base(papers)

# Ask paper-specific questions
response = agent.chat("How do recent papers improve attention efficiency?")
```

This advanced system transforms the Arxiv Agent into a comprehensive research assistant that provides valuable insights in any scenario while maintaining the ability to incorporate specific research findings when available.
